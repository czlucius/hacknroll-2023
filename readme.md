# Hack&Roll Project for 2023 - Eye Care
## Inspiration
As most people use their web browsers a lot everyday to consume content, we decided to create a Web Extension to minimise its harm on people
## Features
- Screen time alarm
- Blue light filter
## Build With
- HTML/CSS/JS
- `WebExtensions` API
## Support Browsers
As Chrome does not support the `browser` namespace with promises, which is proposed by the W3 Browser Extensions group, we could not support Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. Firefox and Safari (Gecko & WebKit) are supported.
